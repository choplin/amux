# Quick Start

Get started with Amux in minutes.

## Workspace Basics

### 1. Initialize Amux

Navigate to your project and initialize Amux:

```bash
cd your-project
amux init
```

This creates a `.amux/` directory to store workspace metadata.

### 2. Create a Workspace

```bash
amux ws create feature-auth
```

You now have an isolated Git worktree ready for development!

### 3. List Your Workspaces

```bash
amux ws list
```

Output:

```text
ID  NAME          BRANCH                           CREATED
1   feature-auth  amux/workspace-feature-auth-...  2 minutes ago
```

## Working with AI Agents

If you have AI agents configured, you can run them in your workspaces:

### 4. Run an AI Agent

```bash
amux run claude --workspace feature-auth
```

### 5. List Sessions

Check your running AI agents:

```bash
amux ps
```

Output:

```text
ID  NAME     AGENT   WORKSPACE     STATUS
1   sess-1   claude  feature-auth  ðŸŸ¢ running
```

### 6. Attach to AI Agent

Connect to your running AI agent for interactive work:

```bash
amux attach 1  # Use session ID from 'amux ps'
```

Exit the session with `Ctrl+B` then `D` (detach) or `exit` (terminate).

## What You've Achieved

### Workspace Setup

âœ… Initialized Amux in your project
âœ… Created an isolated workspace for feature development
âœ… Learned how to manage multiple workspaces

### AI Agent Integration (if completed)

âœ… Started an AI agent in an isolated environment
âœ… Monitored running sessions
âœ… Connected to your AI agent for interactive work

You're now ready to run multiple AI agents in parallel without conflicts!
