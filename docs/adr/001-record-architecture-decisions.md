# 1. Record Architecture Decisions

Date: 2025-06-10

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We need to record the architectural decisions made on this project to provide context for future developers and
maintainers. Many important decisions about technology choices, migrations, and design philosophy are currently
scattered across various documents or lost in git history.

## Decision

We will use Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) as described by Michael Nygard. ADRs will be stored in `docs/adr/`
and follow a simple markdown template.

## Consequences

- Future maintainers will understand why decisions were made
- Historical context will be preserved
- Migration histories and deprecated approaches will be documented
- CLAUDE.md can focus on current implementation rather than history
