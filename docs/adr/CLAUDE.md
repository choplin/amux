# ADR Writing Instructions

When creating Architecture Decision Records (ADRs):

1. **Read docs/adr/README.md** and follow the template and guidelines exactly
2. **Always run `date` command** to get the correct date in YYYY-MM-DD format before writing the ADR
3. Use the next sequential number (check existing ADRs for the last number)
4. Follow the filename format: `NNN-descriptive-name.md` (e.g., `020-session-status-tracking.md`)
5. Keep the format consistent with existing ADRs
