# AI Agent Memory Archive

This directory contains archived memories and historical context from previous AI agent sessions.
These are preserved for reference but not part of the active project documentation.

## Files

Archive memory files follow the naming pattern: `YYYY-MM-DD-descriptive-title.md`

This ensures chronological ordering and easy identification of memories.

These documents are gitignored and serve as archived AI agent memories.
